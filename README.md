# AnBnCnPDA
This is a very simple AnBnCn Push-down automaton simulation.  This was created as an extra credit assigned for a CSE500 Formal Languages and Automata course at the CSUSB.  It doesn't use transition functions, but simply simulated a two-stack scenario for a PDA to be able to check if a string is in AnBnCn language.
